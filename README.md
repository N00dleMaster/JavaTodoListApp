# JavaTodoListApp
A to-do list app written in Java, using JavaFX and FXML for the UI.

## How to use
Download the files. Run 'em. This was made using IntelliJ Idea, so I'm not sure you can open it in Eclipse.

## Features
1. **Add todos**
2. **Mark todos as done or undone**
3. **Filter todos by done or undone**
4. **Delete todos**
5. **Save todos** (Write them to a file)

## Contributing
You know the drill. Make a pull request. I'd honestly be really flattered if you want to help improve this project for forgetful people everywhere!
